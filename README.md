# zinit-annex-submods

## Introduction

An annex (i.e., an extension for
[Zinit](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit) â€“
[more information](https://zdharma-continuum.github.io/zinit/wiki/Annexes/))
that allows Zinit to clone additional submodules when installing a plugin or
snippet. The submodules are then automatically updated on the `zinit update ...`
command.

This annex adds the `submods''` ice to Zinit which has the following syntax:

```zsh
submods'{user}/{plugin} -> {output directory}; ...'
```

## Installation

Load as a plugin that installs the annex within Zinit:

```zsh
zinit light zinit-zsh/zinit-annex-submods
```

After this, you can use the `submods` ice.
